 Data science is the domain of study that deals with  vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques  to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information,  and make business decisions. Data science uses  complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive  models.  
 The data used for analysis can be from multiple  sources and present in various formats.  
 \section{Why Data Science?}  
 Data science or data-driven science enables better  decision making, predictive analysis, and pattern  discovery. It lets us:  
 a. Find the leading cause of a problem by asking the  right questions\\  
 b. Perform exploratory study on the data\\   c. Model the data using various algorithms \\   d. Communicate and visualize the results via graphs,  dashboards, etc.\\  
 \section{Prerequisites for Data Science}  
 Here are some of the technical concepts you should  know about before starting to learn what is data science.  
\subsection{ Machine Learning} 
PAGE-21  
Machine learning is the backbone of data science. Data  Scientists need to have a solid grasp on ML in addition  to basic knowledge of statistics.  
\subsection{Modeling}  
Mathematical models enable you to make quick  calculations and predictions based on what you already  know about the data. Modeling is also a part of ML and  involves identifying which algorithm is the most suitable  to solve a given problem and how to train these models.  \subsection{Statistics}  
Statistics are at the core of data science. A sturdy  handle on statistics can help you extract more  intelligence and obtain more meaningful results.  
\subsection{Programming}  
Some level of programming is required to execute a  successful data science project. The most common  programming languages are Python, and R. Python is  especially popular because it’s easy to learn, and it  supports multiple libraries for data science and ML.   \subsection{Databases}  
A capable data scientist, you need to understand how  databases work, how to manage them, and how to  extract data from them.//

\section{APPLICATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE} 
PAGE-23  
Data science has found its applications in almost every  industry.  
\subsection{Healthcare}  
Healthcare companies are using data science to build  sophisticated medical instruments to detect and cure  diseases.  
\subsection{Gaming}  
Video and computer games are now being created with  the help of data science and that has taken the gaming  experience to the next level.  
\subsection{Image recognition}  
Identifying patterns in images and detecting objects in  an image is one of the most popular data science  applications.  
\subsection{Logistics}  
Data Science is used by logistics companies to optimize  routes to ensure faster delivery of products and increase  operational efficiency.  
\subsubsection{Fraud detection}  
Banking and financial institutions use data science and  related algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.  
\section{Data science as a career} 
PAGE-24  
Over the last five years, the job vacancies for data  science and its related roles have grown significantly.  Glassdoor has named data scientist as the number one  job in the United States as per its 2019 report. The U.S.  Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the rise of data  science needs will create 11.5 million jobs by 2026.  
There are several job roles that you can look for in the  data science domain.  
Some of the important job roles are:  
Data Scientist  
Machine Learning Engineer  
Data Consultant  
Data Analyst  
According to Glassdoor, the average salary of a data  scientist in the United States is USD 113,000 per annum  and in India, it’s 907,000 Rupees per annum.  \section{References}
